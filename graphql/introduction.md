# GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language that provides a new way of coding your API layer end points which is more flexible and efficient compared to REST.

With GraphQL:
- client can specify exactly what data it needs and in what format it needs the data
- you can specify your data model schemas with strongly typed data types using GraphQL's Schema Language
- its easy to aggregate data from multiple sources with just one call compared to multiple calls that may be needed with REST
