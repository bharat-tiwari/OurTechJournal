# Introduction

This documentation has been created by members of [JSified-brains](https://github.com/jsified-brains) team with a primary purpose of scribbling down our learnings on various Web development technologies that we've learnt while working on [our web projects and applications](https://github.com/jsified-brains).

We chose to use Gitbook platform to jot down our notes \(along with examples created on JSFiddle whenever possible\), for our own easy-to-find reference and also to share it online with the community.

The topics we scribble down here are sort of quick reference, may not be exhaustive, the purpose is not to provide a complete or in-depth coverage on any particular topic. Links are sometimes included that we find are good resource for a more in-depth coverage. Topics are mostly random, anything that any one of us feels worth noting down.
