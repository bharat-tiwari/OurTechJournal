# Mixins

A `mixin` is like a function that allows us to define a set of CSS declarations and make it reusable by parameterizing it. One of the very common use case of `mixin` is for properties that need vendor prefixes. With so many vendor prefixes, its very tedious to declare a property that needs vendor prefix, especially when we are declaring multiple CSS classes that use the same property with different sets of the property values.
