# SASS Maps

A Map in SASS is a data structure similar to dictionary in most of the programming languages (or Map in ES6). Its a set of key-value pairs. A very common use case of map is to define a set of theme colors like below:

```scss
$siteThemeColors (
    default: #ccc,
    primary: #3399ff,
    warning: #ff9900,
    success: #33cc33,
    danger: #ff3300 
)
```
